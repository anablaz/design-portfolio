# design-portfolio

Throughout my studies and internships, I had the opportunity to contribute to several design projects, most notably the complete redesign of a Microsoft product: the M365 Accessibility Checker Report (not yet launched). While my primary role was product manager, I actively led the design and accessibility aspects of the project, collaborating with various stakeholders to ensure success.

The product is a Microsoft Teams app designed to collect accessibility metrics across M365 documents within an organization's cloud. It generates detailed reports aimed at improving document accessibility across the organization. The biggest challenge was crafting a design that adhered to Microsoft's app branding guidelines while ensuring the final product was both accessible and user-friendly.
